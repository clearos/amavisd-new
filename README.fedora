INSTALLATION
------------
Installing amavisd-new from Fedora is simple.  First, install the
amavisd-new package:

  yum -y install amavisd-new

Don't be alarmed at the number of dependencies this installs.  This
package tries to be as full-featured as possible, including many
optional components for amavisd-new.

Next, configure amavisd-new to start on boot:

  chkconfig --level 2345 amavisd on

If you want to use the Clam Antivirus daemon (recommended), set it to
start on boot as well:

  chkconfig --level 2345 clamd.amavisd on

When you are ready, start the clamd.amavisd (optional but recommended)
and amavisd services:

  service clamd.amavisd start
  service amavisd start

Check /var/log/maillog for startup messages from both daemons.

The next step is to integrate amavisd with your MTA.

POSTFIX
-------
The simplest method for enabling amavisd-new support in postfix is to
use the content_filter configuration option to tell postfix to relay
mail through amavisd-new using SMTP.  In this configuration, incoming
mail passes from postfix to amavisd and back to postfix.  (Mail never
actually leaves the control of postfix however, since amavisd does not
answer OK until it scans the message and transfers it back to postfix.
The worst that can happen is a failure at just the right time could
allow a message to be queued twice.)

Add the following to /etc/postfix/main.cf:

  content_filter = smtp:[127.0.0.1]:10024

You will probably also want to limit the number of postfix processes
to keep mail from coming in faster than it can be processed by adding
the following to /etc/postfix/main.cf:

  default_process_limit = 20

Add the following to /etc/postfix/master.cf:

  127.0.0.1:10025 inet n - - - 0 smtpd -o content_filter=

Be sure to read the TUNING section in README.postfix for information
on process limits.
